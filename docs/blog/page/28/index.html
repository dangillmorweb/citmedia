				<p><em> (This is the fifth in a series of postings about citizen media business issues. See the <a href=../../2007/09/24/making-a-business-of-citizen-media>introduction</a> here. All of these entries are considered to be in “beta” and will be revised and refined as they find a home on a more permanent area of the Center for Citizen Media web site.   To that end, your comments, additional examples, and criticisms are welcome and will be invaluable contributions to this process.)</em></p>
<p><em> </em><br>
Not every business model includes the direct exchange of money. A blog or other website can have an economic impact in more indirect ways, such as branding and promotion. While such sites <em>can</em> use affiliate links, banner ads and other means to raise money, they’re much more about playing a supportive role in boosting the career of the author.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear first what we’re not talking about: pure marketing or sales sites. Almost any business’s web site that exists solely to sell a product or service fits into this category.</p>
<p>One group that has learned to use blogs and other conversational media effectively is lawyers, who’ve even created a clever word for the genre: <em>blawgs</em>.  The term, which, by most accounts, was coined by <a href=http://bgbg.blogspot.com/>Bag and Baggage’s</a> Denise Howell, refers to any blog about law (usually by a lawyer).  While the majority of “blawggers” do so in some part for enjoyment, a great professional benefit comes with a well-executed blawg.  An ideal situation would have a lawyer so proficient at running her blawg that it was popular enough to directly attract clients. Indeed, Howell says her blog reinforces her expertise, and that people can easily find her via search engines; the result is significant business derived from the brand she’s created in part via the blog.</p>
<p>As Eric Turkewitz explains in <a href=http://www.newyorkpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/2007/07/is-blawgosphere-stagnating.html>his own blawg</a><em>: </em>“If someone published an article in a legal journal, will that gross them any money? No. Except as an indirect form of marketing as they become known in their field for what they do. Blogging is conceptually no different.”  The benefit of blawgging comes from building a personal brand.  Such can be seen in examples like <a href=http://www.masslawblog.com/>MassLawBlog</a>, <a href=http://www.groklaw.net/>GrokLaw</a>, and <a href=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/about.html>PrawfsBlawg</a>.</p>
<p>The last of those, <a href=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/about.html>PrawfsBlawg</a>, is a blawg written by <em>professors</em> of law. Blogging by academics, once widely regarded as professionally dangerous (see Ivan Tribble’s 2005 article <a href=http://chronicle.com/jobs/2005/07/2005070801c.htm>“Bloggers Need Not Apply”</a>), has trended towards widespread use as a showcase for ideas and research, not to mention an avenue for getting one’s name out.  Just as getting one’s name out could mean more clients for a lawyer, it could mean more (or higher-profile) consulting gigs for an academic.  One of the earliest and best threads on the subject is from <a href=http://crookedtimber.org/2004/03/16/academics-and-blogging>CrookedTimber</a> in a post that asked academics if and why they write or read blogs.  Some of the common themes from the numerous answers involved the idea of personal branding, but other reasons included writing practice, class preparation, sharing and getting feedback on research, and using their blog as a platform to discuss or start work on a publication of some kind.</p>
<p>Eric Gordon, Assistant Professor of New Media at Emerson  College and author of <a href=http://placeofsocialmedia.com/blog/index.php>PlaceofSocialMedia</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>While [books and academic journals] are still essential for career building, increasingly, scholars are looking to blogs to assess “what’s going on.” Beyond the assumed affordances of blogging – immediate, networked, participatory – it has taken on a new function of stake-claiming.  For instance, I’m working on a book about location-based media and situated computing.  If I were to simply write it and wait for it to “hit the stands,” it wouldn’t be until mid-2009 that I could join the conversation.  Through my blog, I am able to join the conversation right now by opening up the research process to readers.  This is good for two reasons: 1) I can join the conversation, and 2) I can begin building a reputation based on a work-in-progress.  With the rapidity in which technologies change, this rapid-prototyping of academic ideas has become essential to intellectual and cultural life. <em>[Disclosure: Eric Gordon is one of my professors and advisors at Emerson.]</em></blockquote>
<p>Writers of all kinds are using blogs to promote, research, and develop their books.  Several examples of this can be found in the comments of <a href=http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2006/07/are_you_using_a.html>this thread</a> on <a href=http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/>Global Neighbourhoods</a>, which is, appropriately, a blog started in 2004 to promote a book that is still regularly updated today.</p>
<p>Professionals and academics are not the only people using blogs to enhance their careers. <a href=http://almostdalyblog.blogspot.com/>AlmostDailyBlog</a> is run by an animator who, since making the switch to computer graphics, found he missed drawing and so created a blog to post doodles.  As it became more popular, he started to sell prints and eventually put out a book of them—all stemming primarily from his blog and networking with other animation bloggers.</p>
<p>Business blogs have a similar purpose. Technology companies such as Sun Microsystems and Microsoft have launched a variety of blogs, including a popular <a href=http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/>CEO blog</a> by Sun’s Jonathan Schwartz. Smaller enterprises benefit, too. <a href=http://blog.clearadmit.com/>ClearAdmit</a> runs a very detailed blog as part of its site dedicated to providing information about MBA schools, programs, and the admissions process.  These all serve to build the ClearAdmit name and reputation so that, when the time comes, interested parties may think of ClearAdmit for its off-line consulting services and events.</p>
<p>A word of caution, however: Just as a great blog can build personal brand, a rarely updated smattering of nonsensical or thoughtless entries or a page that looks like it came direct from a public relations department can be more of a drawback than aid.  The best blogs have human voices and/or relentlessly useful information; they don’t sound corporate or like a sales or PR pitch. Also, with the rate at which blogs are increasingly aggregated, archived, and referenced on the web, an unflattering moment has the potential to haunt you.</p>
<p>For anybody passionate about what they do and with enough time to commit, blogging is a way to not only develop your own knowledge and skills, but also to share them, get feedback, and (most importantly in the context of this series of postings) to build a personal or business brand.  If your only goal is to market yourself in the short-term, you may want to consider other avenues.</p>

<p>I’m baffled that Fox can get away with this. Doesn’t fair use cover the candidates’ use of images of this sort?</p>
<p>Beyond that, why is Fox shooting itself in the foot so stupidly? The network is dishonest — “fair and balanced,” uh huh — but no one has ever called its executives stupid.</p>

			<div class=entry-content>
				<p>In the Business Week article I point to in the posting below, Steve Hamm quotes me (very) briefly. Here’s our full exchange (I’ve combined two emails):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Question: Could the Mercury News or Knight Ridder have done a better job of keeping their readers or gaining new ones? If so, how?</em></blockquote>
<p><em> </em>Answer: The trends — demographic, financial and technological — have been working against the newspaper industry for some time. The Merc and KR were caught in a particularly bad bind given the collapse of not just the tech bubble but also the tech-advertising bubble.</p>
<p>That said, there’s always room for improvement. For example, the paper (and company) didn’t take advantage of the vertical-market opportunity offered by SiliconValley.com, a truly baffling misstep from my perspective.</p>
<p>And I continue to think that we should have jumped harder into conversational space with readers, offering a variety of initiatives such as reader blogs and a much deeper connection to the communities. (Not, of course, that this has happened in many other papers; the industry is only now getting why this matters.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Question: The newspaper is trying to reinvent itself now. Is it too late?</em></blockquote>
<p><em> </em>Answer: Probably, but not definitely. Newspapers could still become the places that are community centers. Pretty late to get going on this, however.</p>
<p>As for the Merc, some terrific folks are still there despite the bloodletting. They understand (I think) that they’ll need to get radical about adapting to the new reality.</p>
<p>What I don’t know is whether the new owners are basically in business to milk the thing dry or (at least try) to create a sustainable and serious operation for the new world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Question: When and why did you leave?</em></blockquote>
<p><em> </em>Answer: Early 2005. It was time; for one thing, I didn’t want to be one of those columnists who gets predictable and tedious. I’d done the book on citizen media (“We the Media”) and had an opportunity to put some of the ideas into practice. The first experiment didn’t work out, but I’m working on a bunch of projects (and investing in or advising some others) that are at least promising. I do sometimes miss the gig, which was incredibly fun and satisfying (not to mention the extravagant compensation), but I didn’t want to look back in 10 years and realize that I’d missed my chance to make a difference in the infancy of something genuinely transformative.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Question:  When you were still at the Merc, did the staff warmly and aggressively pursue the opportunity to publish online, including breaking news and exploring new forms like Blogs? Can you think of an anecdote from that time that illustrates whether they went after this or not?</em><br>
<em> </em></blockquote>
<p>Answer: Remember that the Merc was quite early in all this, going back to the AOL days. Was the staff universally enthralled with the new media? No way. But enough folks were experimenting that the operation was a clearly a leading light for a time.</p>
<p>I suspect that most of my newspaper colleagues never even glanced at my blog back in its early days (1999). But keep in mind that SiliconValley.com had a daily online column even then. It took a long time for the Merc to launch its second blog, but again, that was true of the industry in general, too.</p>
<p>The horrible software mess at Knight Ridder Digital (I’m sure you’ve been told about that) slowed down all of the newspapers’ forays into the digital realm. Maybe it was a good business decision, for getting national advertising, but it was a total hairball for people doing the journalism — and they ended up removing years of my blog archives from the Web. That was demoralizing, because it proved the company hadn’t learned the values of the Web in any serious way.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was able to use the blog in pretty much any way that felt right. We were first, I believe, to take posting from the blog and put them into the paper, reversing the usual “repurposing” order. We also used it to break news, such as the Google buyout of the company that created Blogger.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Question: Is TechCrunch to the Mercury News Business section what MTV was to Rolling Stone?</em></blockquote>
<p><em> </em>Answer: I don’t think so, though both are about disruption.</p>
<p>MTV came into being in a world of (relative) media scarcity, even though it was part of a somewhat opened-up ecosystem. MTV took relatively deep pockets to start and get onto cable systems.</p>
<p>TechCrunch can rise because there’s no barrier to entry, at least not at the moment. (The “broadband” duopoly is working hard to fix that…)</p>

				<blockquote><p>Business Week” <a href=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_45/b4057059.htm>A Cautionary Tale for Old Media</a>. <em>The collapse of Silicon Valley’s daily newspaper is in many ways the story of American newspapers in the 21st century. The industry has reached a near-crisis point. Many dailies are losing circulation at an alarming rate, and local newspaper ad spending fell 3.1% last year, to $24.4 billion, while Internet advertising rose 17.3%, to $9.8 billion, according to Advertising Age.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>But the shivers rippling through the Mercury News also serve as a dramatic example of what happens when industry leaders get complacent in the face of fundamental shifts. Andy Grove, who helped sow the Internet revolution when CEO of Intel (INTC ), says that cross-industry disruptions follow a predictable course: Executives ignore the challenges. Then they try to resist. Only when it’s too late do they make radical changes. Grove, who now teaches a strategy course at Stanford University’s School of Business, summarizes the newspaper industry’s prospects: “Your doctor says you’re going to die, but if you don’t smoke, you’ll live a little longer.”</em><em><br>

It’s loaded with excellent examples including the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=114250687465160386813.00043d08ac31fe3357571&amp;om=1&amp;ll=32.994843,-116.924744&amp;spn=1.029693,1.867676&amp;source=embed">KPBS station’s map</a> and the <a href=http://twitter.com/sandiegofire>Twitter channel</a>. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=114250687465160386813.00043d08ac31fe3357571&amp;om=1&amp;ll=32.994843,-116.924744&amp;spn=1.029693,1.867676&amp;source=embed"><br>
</a></p>
<p>The individual efforts are just what you’d anticipate. Here’s one of the many Flickr photos from ground level, this one posted by “<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/ginsnob/>ginsnob</a>“:</p>
<p><a href=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/calfires-ground.jpg title="California Fire, Ground Level"><img width=332 alt="California Fire, Ground Level" height=254 src=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/calfires-ground-150x150.jpg></a></p>
<p>Then, for the ultimate bird’s eye view, here’s what <a href=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/socal_wildfires_oct07.html>NASA has posted</a>:</p>
<p><a href=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/nasa-picture.jpg title="Satellite View of Fires"><img src=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/nasa-picture.jpg alt="Satellite View of Fires"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, people are sending pictures to media organizations like <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/22/irpt.california.fires/index.html>CNN by the thousands</a>. This is going to be the best-covered event in ages.</p>
<p>We are getting the big and little pictures — from the people and organizations who are best able to bring them to us. Just fascinating…</p>

				<p>The Open Net Initiative, in “<a href=http://opennet.net/research/bulletins/013>Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma</a>,”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>examines the role of information technology, citizen journalists, and bloggers  in Burma  and presents a technical analysis of the abrupt shutdown of Internet  connectivity by the Burmese government on September 29, 2007, following its  violent crackdown on protesters there.   Completely cutting international Internet links is rare.  Nepal, which severed all  international Internet connections when the King declared martial law in  February 2005, is the only other state to take such drastic action. Although  extreme, the measures taken by the Burmese government to limit citizens’ use of  the Internet during this crisis are consistent with previous OpenNet Initiative  (ONI) findings in Kyrgyzstan,  Belarus, and Tajikistan,  where authorities controlled access to communication technologies as a way to  limit social mobilization around key political events.  What makes the Burmese junta stand out,  however, is its apparent goal of also preventing information from reaching a  wider international audience.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>This report, compiled in an impressively short period, is must reading to understand how governments are responding to the communications revolution.</p>
<p>As the authors note, the events in Burma provide a “chilling example of the limitations of the Internet.” But there’s also reason for hope:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>However, even the vast majority of Burmese without access to or knowledge of the Internet may have benefited from the enduring achievement of a small band of citizen bloggers and journalists—the uploading of vital, relevant information to the Internet was broadcast back in via television and radio and spread through personal networks and communities throughout the country.</em><em><br>

				<p>Dave Winer has been exploring a superb news resource, <a href=http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/10/22/somethingNewInNews.html>exploring the depth and breadth</a> of the <a href=http://www.nytimes.com>New York Times</a>‘ data-stream. The most traditional of news organizations is opening up, including its archives,in ways that could be truly revolutionary in the news business — and Dave is leading the way toward a new way of seeing a core part of our history and current knowledge.</p>
<p>As he inspires others to do some <a href=http://everwas.com/2007/09/mining-the-ny-times-archives.html>spelunking of their own</a>, the result is that people outside the Times are doing crucial R&amp;D for the world’s most important newspaper — figuring out what’s available in the story archive and current flow that, in many ways, represents a fundamental baseline for journalism about vital topics, and then figuring out how to make it more available, in smarter ways, to more people.</p>
<p>In this morning’s posting, Dave shows us a new <a href=http://nytimesriver.com/outline/>outline view</a> of the Times’ stories, part of what he’s calling “rivers of news” that take headline services to a deeper place. If you have a mobile phone that has a Web browser, load <a href=http://nytimesriver.com/>the New York Times river</a> to see what this means. The outline is, in effect, a taxonomy of what’s happening in the world, and was inspired in large part by people at the newspaper who suggested a direction he might take.</p>
<p>More is coming, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Further, in the process of exploring this, I’ve been shown the work of other developers who discovered the keywords on their own, and one in particular is very interesting. I’m hoping that these projects will come public so I can show them to you and tell you what I think they mean.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know where this will end up, but it’s important work. The Times is being incredibly smart, meanwhile. It’s leveraging the passion of technologists who care about news and journalism. In the end, the value will accrue not just to the paper but to everyone who cares about getting the news they need, when and where they need it.</p>
<p>Kudos all around on this one.</p>
<p><em>(DIsclosure: I own a small amount of New York Times Co. stock, which is currently worth a lot less than I paid for it.)</em></p>

				<p>My friend Walt Mossberg, the Wall Street Journal’s superb tech columnist, has a plea in today’s paper called “<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119264941158362317.html?mod=2_1327.htm_1">Free My Phone</a>” — asking the government force open what he calls the “Soviet Ministry” model of mobile phone service, a system that treats customers as if they were pawns.</p>
<p>Great piece, with one exception, where he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let me be clear: Any company that spends billions to build and maintain a wireless network deserves to be paid for its use, and deserves to make a profit and a return for its shareholders. Not only that, but companies like Verizon Wireless or AT&amp;T Inc. should be free to build or sell phones or software or services.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>Really? Any investment of billions automatically deserves to make a profit and return for its shareholders?</p>
<p>It’s true that in the cartel we call telecommunications, the investment is deemed sufficient to deserve a profit. But it’s <strong>absolutely false</strong> in the system we call capitalism.</p>
<p>In a genuinely free market, you invest your money and you take your chances with the marketplace.</p>
