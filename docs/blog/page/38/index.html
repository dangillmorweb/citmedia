				<p><em>(Note: This is updated from a column I wrote for PR Week magazine last winter.)</em></p>
<p>This week is the annual meeting of the <a href=http://www.aejmc.org>Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, better known in the field as AEJMC, where journalism and communications educators gather to ponder their profession. This will be my fourth such event, and in just a few years citizen journalism has moved from heresy — a topic to be considered, if at all, only in side conferences and hallways — to something that, while still not widely accepted, is at least of interest.</p>
<p>The shift reflects, as far as I can tell, the state of journalism education itself. Newspapers are slow to adapt to the collision of technology and media, but journalism schools may be even slower.</p>
<p>This isn’t all bad. Institutions of higher education <em>should</em> be somewhat conservative in key ways. They should be ardent to preserve things that work even as they look hard at what is new and disruptive. Most importantly for journalism, educators in the field should hold hard and fast, in the best sense of conservatism, to the <a href=http://www.citmedia.org/principles>principles</a> that undergird the honorable craft that, at its best, itself is a foundation for democratic self-rule and a well-informed people.</p>
<p>But in an age of media saturation – when we are all becoming creators of media, using technologies that, in turn, help us become digital collaborators on work of various kinds – the traditional methods no longer suffice. Many J-schools fully recognize this; few — actually none that I’m aware of — have fully adapted to it.</p>
<p>The same issues apply to public relations and advertising education, which are often housed in schools of journalism and communications. Those industries have been considerably more innovative, as pros, than journalism in recent years. I have little doubt those fields’ leaders are making their needs clear to educators, and for the most part getting results.</p>
<p>Journalism education, while evolving, has not kept pace. It needs to expand its reach inside journalism schools, for starters. Then it should move to become a linchpin in the broader but even more essential mission of media literacy in the wider society.</p>
<p>Now there’s plenty of interesting new work at the edges, such as new-media classroom experiments that are helping people see what’s possible. This summer’s <a href=http://www.newsinitiative.org>News21 Initiative</a> projects, funded by two major foundations, are examples; many of the faculty advisors come from traditional media.</p>
<p>But lots of journalism programs still teach courses with names like “Beginning Newswriting,” or some such thing, as part of the core curriculum. How vital is that, especially when personal audio and video are becoming at least as much a part of the storyteller’s toolkit as text? I’m not certain.</p>
<p>In some online educational mini-courses for would-be citizen journalists that I’m helping prepare for a journalism-oriented foundation, we’re not focusing on the how-to. We’re looking at core principles: accuracy, thoroughness, fairness, independence, and transparency. Exploring those, it seemed to me, was the most important first step.</p>
<p>Those principles and related skills are among the ones people will need to be media literate in a media-saturated world. I’d like to see every student take a basic media course at every level of education – not just college, but also grade, middle, and high school. Make Journalism 101 — call it Media Literacy 101 — a requirement for graduation at least from high school, because without understanding the principles of journalism students are going to be ill-equipped in the wider world.</p>
<p>If I led a journalism school, I’d see an opening here: to make Media Literacy 101 a requirement for all students in all parts of the university. It would be good for the faculty. And the university would have something even better to sell to prospective students.</p>
<p>The basics of media literacy should start earlier, far earlier, than college or even high school. What do they include? Skepticism, for starters: Children need to learn to be independent thinkers and not take for granted that what they see, hear, or read is necessarily true or real. (Of course, in today’s timid and authoritarian society, teachers who try to help students think for themselves may be pilloried as radicals; this doesn’t help.)</p>
<p>It also means understanding that we shouldn’t be equally skeptical of everything; that we need to do more reporting ourselves when we are making decisions; and that we need to fully grasp media techniques.</p>
<p>Teenagers and young adults are already enormously skeptical, but too broadly so. They also understand media techniques — at least in creating media — better than their elders. But they have no clue, for the most part, how media are used to manipulate. They need to understand this deeply.</p>
<p>J-schools will need especially to incorporate the conversational-media shift into their work. I hope they’ll become leaders in training would-be professionals on how to engage the audience in journalism, to help communities (of geography and interest) have broad and deep conversations about their futures.</p>
<p>New journalists will have to be entrepreneurs in coming decades. Can the J-schools teach product development in a Web world – and not lose sight of the journalistic principles and practices so vital to a self-governing society? Is there an alternative?</p>
<p>We’re collectively reinventing journalism  over the next decade or two. Journalism schools can lead, or follow. Leading strikes me as a better idea.</p>

				<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>From the Google News blog comes news of a new initiative “<a href=http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/perspectives-about-news-from-people-in.html>Perspectives about the news from people in the news</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We’ll be trying out a mechanism for publishing comments from a special subset of readers: those people or organizations who were actual participants in the story in question. Our long-term vision is that any participant will be able to send in their comments, and we’ll show them next to the articles about the story. Comments will be published in full, without any edits, but marked as “comments” so readers know it’s the individual’s perspective, rather than part of a journalist’s report.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>How will this work? How will Google verify that the people commenting on what’s been written about them are actually the people in question? What kind of data-gathering will this lead to on Google’s part?</p>
<p>The fact that Google is trying this is, in one sense, testament to an abject failure on the part of traditional news operations. With the Net, they could have given people the chance to comment in this way — above and beyond the standard comment published as part of a story or a letter to the editor. They didn’t, and left this opening.</p>
<p>If Google pulls this off, it will be a huge boost for one company — Google — because people looking for responses to news articles will head to the search site, not just to the site of the original story.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating initiative, no matter what. And it’s not too late for news organizations to get their acts together and give the people they write about a convenient platform of their own — Dave Winer suggests <a href=http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/08/08/todaysLinks.html>blogs</a> (“Let the readers sort it out”) — to reply.</p>

				<p>In the New York Times yesterday, the second paragraph of James Risen’s story, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/washington/06nsa.html?ex=1344052800&amp;en=5e759f53fc811cd7&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">Bush Signs Law to Widen Reach for Wiretapping</a>,” reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Congressional aides and others familiar with the details of the law said that its impact went far beyond the small fixes that administration officials had said were needed to gather information about foreign terrorists. They said seemingly subtle changes in legislative language would sharply alter the legal limits on the government’s ability to monitor millions of phone calls and e-mail messages going in and out of the United States.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>Hold on. He feels the need to quote people “familiar with the details of the law” — a huge expansion of police power — implying either that he didn’t read it or that he didn’t have a clue what it meant.</p>
<p>Several questions come quickly to mind.</p>
<p>First, why didn’t the Times journalists either read or understand the law (which runs about <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s1927es.txt.pdf">12 double-spaced pages</a>)? These are, after all, among the elite of the craft.</p>
<p>Second, why didn’t they tell us about this <em>before</em> the law was passed?</p>
<p>Must be too much to ask.</p>

				<blockquote><p>Anil Dash: <a href=http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/08/fake-steve-jobs-and-the-triumph-of-blogs.html>Fake Steve Jobs and the Triumph of Blogs</a>. <em>Daniel Lyons, author of the heretofore-anonymous Fake Steve Jobs blog, which comments extensively on companies in the technology industry, was also the author of Forbes’ November 2005 cover story “Attack of the Blogs”, a 3000-word screed vilifying anonymous bloggers who comment on companies in the technology industry. In 2005, I spoke to Lyons for the article, though the comments I made about both the efforts that have been made to encourage accountability in the blogopshere, as well as the many positive benefits that businesses have accrued from blogging, were omitted from the story.  My initial temptation was to mark Lyons as a hypocrite. Upon reflection, it seems there’s a more profound lesson: The benefits of blogging for one’s career or business are so profound that they were even able to persuade a dedicated detractor.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>The Forbes article in which Lyons trashed the blog world was such a bad piece of journalism that it was easy to discount. But let’s be generous and give Lyons credit for understanding that the new medium is worth trying after all.</p>
<p>Of course, the Fake Steve Jobs blog does a lot of what Lyons complained about in his original Forbes tirade: It’s deliberately unfair, and it is (or was) published anonymously without any serious accountability.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe Lyons just decided to have some fun…</p>

				<p>The <a href=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/>Berkman Center</a> for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School is seeking a Media Fellow to work on a citizen-media project. Details:</p>
<p><strong>Project</strong>: The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society is undertaking a project to comprehensively study the new/citizen/social media landscape, including reflection on its reach, implications, impact, and ecosystem, and charting an agenda for research and action moving forward.  In the beginning, the potential of citizen media seemed limitless – finally there would be a way to overrule the gatekeepers, re-establish nuanced and in-depth analysis, escape commercially-driven news, and use the power of the network to fundamentally change the production and dissemination of knowledge and information.  Citizen media promised democratized news and maybe even democracy itself, giving everyone with a computer and an internet connection access to not only follow – but also shape – the agenda and our understanding thereof.  But after years of hard work and substantial investment, has citizen media lived up to that hope?  Has power really shifted from the center to the edge?  Has the conversation become more informed and inspired?  Who is participating and how can we measure the impact of this new form of media?  How has the dynamic of the media ecosystem changed with respect to interaction between professionals and amateurs, and is it sustainable? We will perform a critical analysis of where citizen media has fallen short, where it has delivered, and how we as a community can help it to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: Working closely with the principal investigator and others in the Berkman community, the research fellow will develop and implement all elements of the project, including: designing and conducting research on diverse relevant topics; writing articles, case studies, blogposts, and project reports; organizing (with logistical support) workshops and major conferences; coordinating contributions from the Berkman community of faculty, fellows, staff, students and others still; and developing supportive tools and media as appropriate.  Other duties/responsibilities include relationship-building, collaboration with others working in this space, content creation and development around the project events, and general promotion of the project through conversation and writing.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: Expert understanding of, healthy skepticism for, and strong interest in both citizen/social media, mainstream and public media are fundamental.  Experience in media field strongly preferred.  Must possess a blend of knowledge, curiosity, openness and self-motivation.  Strong written and oral communication skills are essential, and an advanced degree in relevant field is required.  Familiarity with new media and technology tools and proven ability to coordinate logistics and/or research projects are valuable.  Desire to work for dynamic, mission-driven organization is a must. Must be willing to travel.</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong>: The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School is proud to be celebrating its tenth year as a research program founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development.  Founded in 1997, through a generous gift from Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman, the Center now is home to an ever-growing community of faculty, fellows, staff, and affiliates working on projects that span the intersections among innovation, democracy, learning, law, technology, and policy.  More at http://cyber.law.harvard.edu</p>
<p><strong>Pay</strong>: $48,000 plus full benefits.</p>

				<p>New commenters here must have one comment approved before they can routinely post without moderation. A recent comment contained a Nazi reference, calling a public figure a Nazi (he isn’t one). I deleted it without letting it go through.</p>
<p>In our basic civility-rules stance, comparing people to Nazis is not acceptable. The only exception is if the person being discussed is or was an actual Nazi.</p>
<p>I emailed the person who tried posting the comment, inviting a re-submission with the reference taken out.</p>

				<blockquote><p>Michael Miner (Chicago Reader): <a href=http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/hottype/070803/>Terms of Concealment: How transparent can a news shop be when it sends off former employees with hush money?</a> <em>True transparency, then, is not only too much to hope for but probably more than we’re entitled to. Let sinners come clean to their priests. Newspapers are entitled to their quirky little mysteries.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>But later, it occurred to me, there’s another kind of transparency. A genuinely transparent paper would feel it owes us an explanation whenever a familiar byline disappears. Have you ever read a writer for years, in the Tribune or anywhere else, and then noticed that he or she wasn’t there any more? Did the writer retire? Find a better job? Get fired? Maybe the writer dropped dead at the keyboard? (No, in that case the paper would have run a really sweet obit.)</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>The news business remains one of the most opaque anywhere. Things journalists demand of others are considered impossible when the tables are turned. Hypocritical? Of course. But hardly a surprise, given that business people are in charge.</p>
<p>The answer, as always, is to see stories like Miner’s: tough, thorough and, even if the Tribune might disagree, entirely fair. Media criticism has never been more important.</p>
