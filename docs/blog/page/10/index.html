				<p>In today’s Wall Street Journal story about the deflation of the housing bubble, “<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122341352084512611.html?mod=testMod">Housing Pain Gauge: Nearly 1 in 6 Owners ‘Under Water’</a>,” consider this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Stephanie and Jason Kirschenman thought they were being prudent when they agreed in late 2004 to buy a new four-bedroom home in Lodi, Calif., for $458,000. They put a substantial 20% down and chose a loan with a fixed interest rate for the first 10 years. Two years later, they took out a second mortgage to pay off some bills.</em></p><em>
<p>At the time, the home was appraised for about $550,000. But a mortgage broker recently estimated its value at well below the $380,000 the family owes on it, says Ms. Kirschenman. “We were quite shocked,” she says.</p>
</em><p><em>The Kirschenmans, who both work for a company that makes trailer hitches, thought about sending the keys to the lender. But their financial planner, Christopher Olsen, helped persuade them to stick with the house, noting that they could still afford the payments.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack it a bit, to see why a) the Kirshenmans — the only home buyers cited in this story — deserve little sympathy; and b) why the Journal’s reporter missed some key points.</p>
<p>Lodi, California, is out in the state’s Central Valley, on the outskirts of both the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, the state capital. It had an enormous housing boom — as did many nearby communities — from the late 1990s until a year or two ago, fueled in part by the insane home-price inflation in the Bay Area and Sacramento. Speculators and their enablers (lenders and home builders, chiefly) went wild in the Central Valley during this period, financing and building tract after tract of new homes and pushing up prices of existing ones at rates never before imagined, much less experienced.</p>
<p>Look at this chart, from the <a href=http://www.lodirealtors.org/>Lodi Realtors</a> group:</p>
<p><a href=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/imagesmarket288.jpg onclick="window.open('http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/imagesmarket288.jpg','popup','width=909,height=621,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src=http://kcdme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/imagesmarket288-tm.jpg alt="Lodi housing market" height=200 hspace=4 border=1 width=292 align=left vspace=4 title="Lodi housing market"></a>These are average prices. Median would be better, but the chart still tells the story. In 1998, the average house sold for under $150,000. By 2003 the average price had moved to around $250,000. Things went wild from there. In 2004, when the Kirshenmans bought their big new house, feeling prudent, no doubt, because they put down 20 percent (borrowing at least $370,000 if you consider the various fees that lenders charge), the average sale price had gone over $300,000. Prices peaked in the next several years at $450,000 — triple the average selling price less than a decade earlier.</p>
<p>We learn from the Journal article that the Kirshenmans took out a second mortgage in 2006, near the market’s top, to “pay off some bills” — how much, we don’t learn, but considering that they now say they owe $380,000 they probably borrowed in the range of $10,000 to $15,000. And now, given the plummeting prices in the Central Valley, something that was <em>utterly predictable</em>, they owe more than the place is worth.</p>
<p>Well, cry me a river.</p>
<p>These people, I grant, were more responsible than many of their neighbors. The pure speculation that went on in the Central Valley was nothing short of epic. But they bet on something that could not be sustained, and if they didn’t know that they weren’t paying attention.</p>
<p>The Journal doesn’t even have that excuse. There’s almost no context in this anecdote. Lodi and its surroundings were one of California’s bubble epicenters, are representative only of speculative excess. Isn’t that relevant?</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to see some valuable coverage of the Sacramento area real-estate market, check out <a href=http://sacramentolanding.blogspot.com/>Sacramento Land(ing)</a>, a blog that has been on this story since early 2006.</p>

				<p>UPDATED</p>
<blockquote><p>NY Times: <a href=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/apple-denies-citizen-journalist-report/>Apple Denies ‘Citizen Journalist Report’</a>. <em>Apple’s stock took a brief roller coaster ride this morning after a CNN “citizen journalist” wrote that an “insider” reported that Steve Jobs had been rushed to the hospital with chest pains.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>Aha! Those infernal citizen journalists are ruining the world!</p>
<p>Calm down. CNN got used. Maybe it was an innocent mistake. Quite possibly, however, this was the work of someone whose intention was to briefly torpedo the Apple share price. If so, there’s a high probability that this person will be caught and, one hopes, punished.</p>
<p>But it isn’t the first time something like this has happened. False reports have been posted to public-relations wires, including the famous <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DA1331F935A1575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">Emulex case</a> many years ago when a fraudster — who was caught and punished — pulled just this kind of stunt.</p>
<p>I don’t know too many details about CNN’s iReport internal systems, but I do know that CNN has been running this kind of risk for some time. The labeling of the site has never been, in my view, sufficiently careful to shout at readers that they should not take for granted that anything they see is necessarily true — or that readers who might make any kind of personal or financial decision based on what they see on the site are idiots.</p>
<p>This is precisely the same warning that should (but doesn’t) come with comment boards on major newspaper websites. But you have to believe that no one with a shred of common sense takes the random ranting below, say, a Washington Post article as anything terribly serious.</p>
<p>The “story” quickly moved to financial and tech blogs and traditional media, which probably compounded the damage by giving the report more play. I was on a plane while all this was happening, so all I’m seeing is updated coverage.</p>
<p>The shareholders who panicked are fools. Not the first time. Maybe when enough people get burned after believing things they should ignore, we’ll all recognize that we have to be skeptical of everything — but not equally skeptical of everything.</p>
<p>Media literacy is scarily far behind the curve in a digital-media-saturated world.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A Wired piece entitled “<a href=http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/10/cnn-citizen-jou.html>‘Citizen Journalist’ Could Face Prison for Fake Jobs Story</a>” begins:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The gutsy (and stupid) “citizen journalist” who posted an erroneous story that said CEO Steve Jobs had a heart attack has the hallmarks of a short seller, and it’s likely that he (or she) could face criminal charges and possibly prison time, according to one attorney. </em></blockquote>
<p>Did an editor even glance at this before putting it online?</p>
<p>If the person who posted the false story about Steve Jobs was a short seller aiming to make money by planting a false rumor, then he was anything but a citizen journalist. He was a crook. Period.</p>
<p>Come on, Wired, you can do better than that.</p>

				<p>As Salon notes in “<a href=http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2008/10/02/china_internet/>Skype sells out to China</a>“, the eBay-owned service has collaborated with a Chinese company to enable spying on the allegedly encrypted messages that Skype users send each other to and from, and within, China. This disgusting sellout should surprise no one.</p>
<p>Skype and its corporate parent, eBay, have been evasive about whether the product is truly secure. There’s ample reason — including <a href=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/113353>this admission</a> attributed to an Austrian law-enforcement agency — to suspect that the company has created backdoors for police.</p>
<p>Skype, for its part, has never outright denied that it has done so. Nor has it shown its encryption algorithms in an open way to outside experts for verification and analysis. I take this as an admission that you can’t trust Skype’s encryption, period.</p>
<p>This is important to citizen-media people for several reasons. First, plenty of regimes make it downright dangerous to indulge in truly free speech. Skype has been a favored tool for many people who believed the built-in encryption somehow would protect them.</p>
<p>Second, it’s another example of the way companies from the West collaborate with the globe’s most dictatorial regimes — and it makes abundantly clear that we need an open-source communications toolset that we can trust.</p>
<p>Skype is better than no encryption at all. But do not imagine for a minute that you can fully trust this company, because you can’t.</p>

<p>This chest-thumping deserves as much credibility as Sarah Palin’s claims to foreign-policy expertise.</p>
<p>I’m working on a longer piece about this, but I’ll say again what I’ve been saying in recent months: Whether traditional media people want to admit it or not — they obviously do not — they didn’t do nearly the job they should have. The <em>occasional</em> good story about the risks doesn’t begin to make up for the incessant cheerleading the press did during the inflation of this bubble, not to mention the stock bubble of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: If the media had done their jobs, would there have been such widespread shock at discovering the mess we’re in? This answers itself. The answer is a loud No. It should inspire shame, not bragging.</p>

				<p>In a long investigative piece on John McCain and the gambling industry – “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">For McCain and Team, a Host of Ties to Gambling</a>” — the New York Times has done something noteworthy beyond excellent reporting. It doesn’t adopt the misleading word “gaming” that the gambling industry prefers to use in describing itself.</p>
<p>Several people quoted in the story use the word “gaming,” and it shows up in the name of an organization that lobbies for the gambling industry. So there was no way to entirely avoid using that misleading word, which sounds so much more benign than the reality — which is entirely the point, of course.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Times editors and reporters who got this right. They are almost alone in modern journalism in this regard, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Now if we could only get the newspaper to call torture what it is instead of <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/washington/25detain.html>“harsh interrogation tactics”</a> and other such bogus language.</p>
<p>And (longer range), wouldn’t it be great if journalists stopped using “earn” and “worth” to falsely describe the income and wealth of people who have rigged the financial system and robbed the rest of us blind…</p>

				<blockquote><p>Citizen Media Law Project:  <a href=http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2008/new-insurance-program-bloggers-offered-media-bloggers-association>New Insurance Program for Bloggers Offered by the Media Bloggers Association</a>. <em>The new insurance, which is currently available only to members of the </em><em><a href=http://www.mediabloggers.org/mba-announcement/media-bloggers-association-launches-education-legal-advisory-and-liability-insurance-program-for-bloggers>Media Bloggers Association</a></em><em> (MBA), provides coverage for defamation, invasion of privacy, and copyright infringement claims.  Premiums start at $450 per year for $100,000/$300,000 in coverage ($100,000 per claim and $300,000 aggregate per year) and go up from there depending on how much revenue your blog or site generates and the type of content. </em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>This is a big deal, and kudos to MBA’s Robert Cox for his work in getting this going.</p>
<p>Bloggers are not immune from the law, and they need to understand this clearly. Insurance is a pain, but it’s not a frivolous expense.</p>

				<p>Here’s the latest from the <a href=http://knightfoundation.org>John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> (funder of some of our work) on its <a href=http://newschallenge.org>21st Century News Challenge</a>, a contest awarding as much as $5 million for innovative ideas using digital experiments to transform community news and information exchange. The deadline for applications is Nov. 1, 2008.</p>
<p>With the slogan “You Invent It. We Fund It!” the contest is open to community-minded innovators worldwide, from software designers to journalists to citizens and students of any age. Do you have a big idea for informing and inspiring a geographic community using social media, Web 2.0 tools or OpenID? How about exchanging information via video, photos or text messaging?  A way to integrate game theory with web browsing to support local community engagement?  Come on, push the edge – we’re seeking true innovation!</p>
<p>Link: www.newschallenge.org<br>
Press release: http://www.newschallenge.org/199/worldwide-contest-reopens-5-million-digital-media-experiments-innovate-journalism.html</p>
<p>To support applications, Knight has created a new incubator — the News Challenge Garage — where prospective applicants can receive peer reviews and mentoring from screeners and awardees from previous years.  To date, over 80 applications are incubating in the Drupal-based Garage site.</p>
<p>Link: http://garage.newschallenge.org</p>
<p>A diverse group of developers, online journalists, nonprofit evangelists, video bloggers and social media experts are on hand to coach at garage.newschallenge.com. The 50 mentors are available to coach and guide everyone who enters a project in the Garage. They include Vidoop’s Chris Messina, Spot.us’ David Cohn, Contentious editor Amy Gahran, Placeblogger’s Lisa Williams, Beth Kanter, J.D. Lasica and many other digital media specialists.</p>

<p>The Knight News Challenge is incorporating new media tools to reach out to more diverse communities to spread the word about this year’s Challenge. For frequent updates, highlights of applications in the Garage, and to ask questions about application guidelines, check out Knight’s Twitter feed (link below). For information on the Garage, the new DotSub video has already been translated into Arabic, Danish, Flemish, Portugese, Japanese and Russian. To reach out to video bloggers, Knight has reached out via Seesmic video, creating an online video conversation with over 40 responses. The KNC FriendFeed room provides a forum for questions and discussions about applications and incubator ideas.</p>

<p>The first two years year of the contest produced individual, private and public winners ranging from Twentysomething journalism innovators to the inventor of the World Wide Web. Winning projects included:</p>
<p>•       ChiTownDailyNews.org: Recruits and trains a network of 75 citizen journalists – one in each Chicago neighborhood.<br>
•       Everyblock.com: Allows citizens of a large city to learn (and act on) civic information about their neighborhood or block.<br>
•       Spot.us: Pays for local investigative reporting by soliciting financial support from the public.</p>
<p>Winning entries must have three elements: 1) use of a digital media; 2) delivery of  news or information on a shared basis to 3) a geographically defined community. Entries must be open-source and share the software and knowledge created.</p>
<p>“We have committed $25 million over five years to the Knight News Challenge because we believe in media innovation through experimentation,” says Alberto Ibargüen, Knight Foundation president and CEO. “Each winning project is an experiment with the potential to transform how we practice journalism in the digital age.”</p>
<p>“With the addition of the incubator site, we are taking a page from technology companies,” says Gary Kebbel, Knight Foundation’s journalism program director. “We hope that the Garage coaches will help the applicants create even more high quality applications and proposals.”</p>
<p>In September and October, Knight is holding a series of meet-ups in various cities to provide real-time brainstorming and discussion – check newschallenge.org for more information.</p>
<p>A simple online entry form is available at www.newschallenge.org. The web site will accept applications through Nov. 1, 2008. Winners should be announced by the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation invests in journalism excellence worldwide and in the vitality of 26 U.S. communities where the Knight brothers owned newspapers. Since 1950, the foundation has granted more than $400 million to advance quality journalism and freedom of expression. The foundation  focuses on projects with the potential to create transformational change. For more, visit www.knightfoundation.org.</p>
