				<p>In this morning’s <a href=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/11/11/net_gains/>piece in the Boston Globe</a>, reprinted below, is a suggestion for new kind of political debates that would:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>unfold online over the course of days, or even weeks and months. Imagine that one candidate takes a position and poses a question. The opponent would answer with a written response of some predetermined length, but with the help of staff, experts, and the general public. Then the first candidate, again with the help of anyone who wants to join the process, would dissect the response and reply with (we’d hope) a truly nuanced update. Continue this process at length – and repeat it with many other topics.</em></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a bit more detail on how such things would occur:</p>
<p>While they’d include audio, video and other media, they would exist primarily in the more traditional form of text, which is still by far the best for exploring serious issues in serious ways. Questions would be posed by candidates to each other, as well as by journalists and the public. But an answer would not be the end of that round; in fact, it would only be the beginning.</p>
<p>Rebuttals and further rejoinders would be the meat of these conversations. They would not be done on the fly, but would come after the candidates and their staffs had some time to consider their responses. They’d point out flaws and inaccuracies in their opponents’ statements, drilling down into details where warranted. Wherever possible, people would use the Internet’s elemental unit — the hyperlink — to point to source material or other supporting information.</p>
<p>The public’s role could be crucial in this system. They would help their own side come up with rebuttal arguments, offering corrections, new facts and other supporting material. Candidates could use this, or not, as they wished. Wise candidates and their staffs would encourage as much participation as possible.</p>
<p>These moderated events would run for days, maybe for the entire campaign season. They would not be debates in a classical sense, but would definitely be the kinds of conversations that would illuminate the public sphere.</p>
<p>What technologies should we bring to bear on this? We’re limited only by our imaginations. We might, for example, use a “virtual world” such as <a href=http://www.secondlife.com>Second Life</a>, where people would create avatars (representations of themselves), helping personalize what might otherwise feel too remote. We could use online forums for part of the conversation. Wikis, which are sites where anyone can edit the pages, are another potential venue; among other intriguing recent ideas, the International Debate Education Association has launched “<a href=http://wiki.idebate.org/index.php/Welcome_to_Debatepedia%21>Debatepedia</a>,” and its work could help us sort out  the possibilities.</p>
<p>But if I were organizing such an event, I’d start by asking smart people from the political and tech worlds to work together, and with the public that cares about such things, on identifying the best methods. This itself would be a useful debate, and could be a template for a portion of what’s to come.</p>
<p>Again, active moderation would be essential. These online communities could self-police to some degree using tools that work well for this purpose, but the events would likely need some help from people whose role would be to intervene on the side of maintaining civility. Sadly, some people like to wreck anything they find, and politics can be particularly poisonous in the online world.</p>
<p>I’m going to be thinking harder about this in coming months, perhaps in a project format. It’s a start, anyway.</p>

				<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 20pt"><em>I have a piece in today’s Boston Globe called “</em><em><a href=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/11/11/net_gains/>Net gains</a></em><em>” — some suggestions on how to improve politics in the digital age, specifically political debates. Here’s what the Globe ran. In <a href=../../2007/11/11/more-about-new-kinds-of-online-debates>this posting</a> I amplify, as promised, on one part of what follows.<br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>On Thursday night, most of the Democratic presidential candidates will travel to <a href="http://nvdems.com/news.php?newsid=899">Las Vegas</a> for the latest in this election cycle’s “debates.” The quotes around that word are deliberate, because political debates are stuck in a world of television sound bites, after-the-fact spin, and almost blatant contempt for voters.</p>
<p>Mass media, the communications technology that became supreme in the 20th century, has ruined debates. The <a href=http://www.nps.gov/liho/debates.htm>Lincoln-Douglas</a> confrontations in 1858 and other verbal contests were once among the deepest and most revelatory of conversations. They revealed intellect and passion, and illuminated the issues of their day. Today’s mass media, reflecting a cultural short attention span, elevates shallowness.</p>
<p>This year’s endless series of events, with so many candidates aiming for the nominations, have been especially puerile, little more than mini-press conferences and spin sessions. Even when the questions are serious, the time limitations on answers puts a premium on regurgitating canned, semi-clever lines that entertain instead of illuminate. These things are to real debating what motel room art is to Picasso.</p>
<p>But technology can also help restore the debate. The Internet and digital tools – search, blogging, online video, wikis, interactive games, and virtual worlds – are made to order for serious conversations. The collision of technology with media offers an unparalleled chance to hold debates that would illuminate our problems and opportunities and give us true insight into the people who want us to elect them.</p>
<p>The role of technology in politics has always been prominent, notably in communications. The pamphleteers of America’s Revolutionary era, and newspaper people later on, knew how powerful the printing press could be. The telegraph sped the news. Telephones, a one-to-one device, transformed personal communications. Radio and then, even more, television became the ultimate tools: one-to-many megaphones of unparalleled power.</p>
<p>The Internet subsumes all that came before, and adds a many-to-many capability. The democratization of media means that anyone can publish; that what we publish is available to a potentially global community; and that creation naturally leads to conversation and collaboration.</p>
<p>The Net has, of course, already made itself felt on the campaign trail. <a href=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/dean.html>Howard Dean’s 2004 team innovated</a> with blogging and online fund-raising ideas. Former senator George Allen lost his 2006 reelection race in part because of an unflattering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G7gq7GQ71c">video posted on YouTube</a>. In this cycle, the presidential candidates are all over the Internet map, and so are their supporters – witness the now-famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsoXHYICqU">“I’ve got a crush on Obama” video</a> and Mitt Romney’s invitation to his supporters to <a href=http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/romney>create advertisements</a>, among countless other efforts.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some modest attempts to make the Internet part of the debate process. The <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/23/debate.main/>CNN-YouTube Democratic event</a> during the summer (a Republican version is scheduled for Nov. 28), demonstrated at least one thing of value: Regular folks can ask questions that are at least as penetrating, or vapid, as the ones posed by journalists in more typical settings. But post-event chatter focused, to a major extent, on what questioners looked like – and whether CNN and YouTube should have let the audience, not just the journalists, select the questions posed to candidates (the answer is obviously yes). Still, this was a sideshow. We learned almost nothing useful about the candidates or their views.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href=http://debates.news.yahoo.com/>Slate and Yahoo</a> joined forces a few weeks ago to offer a slightly more innovative, roll-your-own version. Voters could select specific questions and issues, and get a brief video lineup of candidates’ views. Yahoo says visitors to the site stuck around for an average of seven minutes, a long time on the Web but a pathetic span for serious voters. Perhaps they’d have delved more deeply had the site included more truly interactive features.</p>
<p>Better still is <a href=http://10questions.com>10Questions.com</a>, created by the TechPresident site working with The New York Times and MSNBC, a site that lets regular folks ask video questions and vote on the ones that get posed to candidates. Then the candidates answer, and the regular folks vote on whether the candidates actually answered.</p>
<p>But we can do even better, using a variety of media and techniques. Consider two approaches, different in character but both aimed at greater understanding.</p>
<p>First, the candidates should agree to hold lengthy, one-on-one debates and then put the results online for the public to slice and dice. Rather than having journalists and/or YouTubers ask the questions, we should leave the questioning to the candidates themselves. Give the candidates time to provide substantial responses, and give them full freedom to follow up on their opponents’ remarks. Moderators could help keep the debate on track and civil.</p>
<p>The videos should be posted online and made freely available. Media organizations, party organizations, interest groups, and private citizens could use increasingly inexpensive digital editing tools to help us sort through the mass of video; for example, someone who cares about healthcare could create a comparison of what each candidate said about the topic.</p>
<p>Then let voters decide what they want to watch. A few will watch everything. Many more will watch several debates, or parts of many.</p>
<p>Certainly this system would ask a great deal of the candidates, including perhaps more of their time than they might wish to spend. It would also demonstrate the utter shallowness of the so-called debates that broadcasters and interest groups sponsor today.</p>
<p>A second approach would be even more ambitious: A debate that would unfold online over the course of days, or even weeks and months. Imagine that one candidate takes a position and poses a question. The opponent would answer with a written response of some predetermined length, but with the help of staff, experts, and the general public. Then the first candidate, again with the help of anyone who wants to join the process, would dissect the response and reply with (we’d hope) a truly nuanced update. Continue this process at length – and repeat it with many other topics.</p>
<p>What would the site look like? What technologies would we use? I have my own ideas, and have posted them on my blog, but I’m just one person; we need a collective effort to figure this out, using much the same iterative process. The specific tools are less important than the willingness to deploy them.</p>
<p>Indeed, we’d start with an inventory of what people are already doing. Nonpolitical online conversations are already achieving remarkable depth and breadth using a variety of methods.</p>
<p>But before we finish yet another campaign cycle in the traditional way, let’s resolve to bring debating into the new century. We have the ability to turn top-down, sell-the-candidate methods of electioneering into edge-in conversations among candidates and the electorate. I’ll happen eventually. Why not this time?</p>

				<p>Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo asks readers’ help on <a href=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/058421.php>two stories</a> he and his colleagues are working on:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>First, our reporters are digging into the Mukasey confirmation story, trying to find out just what went down yesterday, what the deal was that Reid held out for, how it was exactly that the presidential candidates didn’t get back or weren’t given enough time to get back for the vote. So this one’s particularly for our regulars up on Capitol Hill. Drop us a line, confidentiality guaranteed, and let us know what you know. I hear that at least some of the presidentials got little or no warning that the vote was imminent.</em></blockquote>
<p>and the Bernie Kerik (Guiliani’s pal) saga:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So we’re going to put together what we hope will be a definitive list of Kerik criminality and ridiculousness. So send in your favorite Kerik scam or scandal for inclusion in our list. You can also post your entries in </em><em><a href=http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/004674.php>this discussion</a></em><em> we’ve just started over at TPMmuckraker.com.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>There are already some interesting results showing up in that discussion.</p>

				<p><a href=http://www.minnpost.com/>MinnPost.com</a> has launched — and it’ll be a useful addition to the journalism scene in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. As far as I can tell, however, it has nearly zero to do with edge-in community journalism.</p>
<p>Still, an interesting experiment and one to watch.</p>

				<p>The folks at the <a href=http://www.tacticaltech.org/node/379>Tactical Technology Collective</a> are planning to release soon a “Citizen Journalism Toolkit” that</p>
<blockquote><p><em> will provide accessible and effective training materials on selected free software tools and web applications with a focus on giving people what they need to know in order to create and distribute content. The materials will cover print publishing, using images, online publishing and audio. </em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to giving this a whirl.</p>
<p>But tools are less important, by far, than community building and commitment. However valuable this kit will be, the people who use it are the key to any success.</p>

				<p>This <a href=http://cronkite.asu.edu/news/gillmor-110607.php>release</a> was posted today at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Here’s the top:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dan Gillmor, an internationally recognized author and leader in new media and citizen-based journalism, will be the founding director of the new Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Arizona State University announced today.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>Gillmor, director of the Center for Citizen Media, will start Jan. 1 as Knight Center director and Kauffman Professor of Digital Media Entrepreneurship. He will hold the faculty rank of professor of practice.</em><em><br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>This is a hugely exciting opportunity, and I’ll be saying more about it in a subsequent posting.</p>
